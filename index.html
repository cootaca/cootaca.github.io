            <p class="text-white-50">
              Warren Buffett was born on August 30, 1930, in Omaha, Nebraska. He
              was born to his mother, Leila, and his father, Howard, a former
              stockbroker turned senator. Buffett showed an incredible acumen
              for business and money from an early age. He was able to resell
              Coca-Cola bottles when he was only six years old, and by the time
              Buffett was eleven, he was already investing in the stock market.
              Though Buffett showed incredible interest in finance, he was
              always skeptical about attending higher educational institutions.
              However, his father convinced him to study up to a graduate level.
              Buffett ended up pursuing the Masters in Economics program at
              Columbia University, where the legendary Ben Graham mentored him.

            <h2 class="mb-4">Professional Background</h2>
            <p class="">
              After graduating from Columbia University, Warren Buffett returned
              home to take a job at his father's brokerage. Soon after, he met
              Susie Thompson, who soon became his first wife. During that time,
              Buffett had investments in a Omaha gas station and some real
              estate. That's when Ben Graham called Buffett to offer him an
              opportunity to work for his brokerage, and Buffett promptly
              accepted the offer. However, Graham and Buffett had very different
              philosophies about investing. Graham was intensely focused on just
              the numbers of the corporation, while Buffett was more interested
              in the company's management. In the six years he worked at
              Graham's Brokerage, Buffett grew his capital from 9,800 dollars to
              140,000 dollars (equivalent to 1,333,000 today when adjusted for
              inflation). Buffett brought his stash back to Omaha and decided to
              create Buffett Associates, Ltd. Buffett managed to convince close
              relatives and other associates to give him their money to grow,
              which is the service he offered. By the end of the year, he had
              over 300,000 dollars in capital. Buffett only took 25% percent of
              profits over 4 percent, a low fee, and produced incredibly high
              returns, making the firm attractive for prospective investors.
              <br /><br />
              Over the next five years, Buffett generated an impressive 251%
              profit (the Dow was up only 74% during that time). Buffett
              Associates evolved into Buffett Partnership Ltd., and ten years
              after its founding, its assets were up 1150%. During that period,
              Buffett established a 49 percent stake in Berkshire Hathaway. At
              that point, Buffett decided to buy the company outright for 8.6
              million dollars. Buffett's addition of an insuring and banking
              division in the company proved to be far more lucrative than the
              textile industry, Berkshire Hathaway's former focus. Textile
              profits were a minor 45,000 dollars that paled compared to the
              banking and insurance profits of 4.7 million dollars. As the
              banking division continued to grow, Buffett decided to buy See's
              candies, a chocolate company that Californians are willing to pay
              a steep premium for. Buffett also began to build equity in GEICO
              and managed to turn it around from steep losses to enormous
              profits. Eventually, GEICO became a full subsidiary of Berkshire
              Hathaway. Berkshire Hathaway continued to make incredibly
              profitable acquisitions consistently. Buffett purchased Scott and
              Fetzer and the Nebraska Furniture Market. Buffett also bought 7
              percent of Coca Cola for about 1 billion dollars (Berkshire's
              stake in Coca Cola is currently worth 22 billion dollars).
              Berkshire Hathaway continued to show astronomical growth and
              slowly grew to the conglomerate we know today.

                Warren Buffett revolutionized the investing and business world.
                With a focus on management and the product ideal rather than
                solely numbers or unfounded speculation (as was done in Wall
                Street's old days), Buffett was perhaps the first significant
                value investor. In addition, Buffett was able to successfully
                take over businesses that were struggling due to poor management
                rather than the product itself and generate massive growth
                within those companies. Buffett spurred a new age of investing
                and even a new model of business management.

            <p>
              Warren Buffett wasn't able to build one of the world's largest
              holding companies without encountering massive issues. Right as
              Buffett started his career, he made a mistake buying an Omaha gas
              station positioned directly across the street from a Texaco
              station. Of course, the vast majority of traffic in that area
              refilled their gas from the Texaco station because it had name
              recognition. Buffett used this experience to put a heavier
              emphasis on brand perception and recognition moving forward. One
              of the major controversies that Berkshire Hathaway faced was the
              Saloman Brothers incident. By 1990 Berkshire Hathaway had acquired
              a 12% interest in the Salomon Brothers investment bank. In 1990
              news came out that a rogue trader from Salomon Brothers had
              submitted bids in excess of Treasury rules, and the CEO of the
              bank failed to reprimand the trader. The treasury department was
              threatening to destroy the company when Buffett stepped in and
              negotiated a 290 million dollar fine to be levied against the
              investment bank instead of obliterating the bank outright. Another
              challenge Berkshire Hathaway faced was the market crash of 1987 in
              which Berkshire Hathaway lost 1/4 of its market cap; however,
              Buffett managed to push through that tumultuous period with a
              clear head and grew Berkshire Hathaway to become far more
              profitable and valuable.

                Warren Buffett has signed the giving pledge meaning that he will
                give away more than 99% of his wealth. Warren Buffett has
                already given tens of billions of dollars to charity. Buffett
                donates to a vast range of charities such as the Bill and
                Melinda Gates foundation and numerous charities involved with
                humanitarian aid.

                I like the way Buffett presents himself, and the actions he
                takes. Buffett takes total responsibility as the chief executive
                officer of a massive corporation. In addition, he acknowledges
                his own luck in making it to where he is today. He also pledged
                to donate the overwhelming majority of wealth for philanthropic
                causes, so he must feel some ethical/moral responsibility to do
                so. So overall, I gained a positive perception of Buffett as I
                researched him.
